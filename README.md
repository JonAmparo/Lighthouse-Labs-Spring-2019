# Lighthouse-Labs-Spring-2019

21-Day Coding Challenge Welcome to the Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge! Over the next 21 days you’ll be travelling aboard the exploratory vessel ISS Lighthouse, on a mission to explore the galaxy.  Just as you depart the solar system, a gigantic space bug knocks you off course! As the ISS Lighthouse captain, you’ll need to solve daily coding challenges to repair the ship and continue on your mission.  Remember: We only release ONE challenge a day but you can now catchup to the current challenge if you fall behind.  Click on the flashing radar below to start the first challenge. A new challenge will be unlocked every day at midnight PST. Complete all the challenges until the grid below is completely filled. Have fun!

### Global objects

There are a few objects you're going to be working with and their initial values. This is only a subset of them, to give you a idea of what they look like. You can see below that they're all messed up:
```
var navigation = {
  x: -2,
  y: "Banana",
  z: "Beep",
  speed: "raaaaid"
};

var ship = {
  powerOn: false,
  modules: [],
  antenna: {
    active: false
  }
};

var radio = {
  frequency: "Kenneth",
  message: "Bugs are cool.",
  beacon: false
};
```

## Challenge #1
You are the captain of the exploratory vessel, the ISS Lighthouse, on a mission to explore the galaxy. Just as you depart the solar system, you encounter a gigantic space bug, which knocks you off course! Now you're lost in space, your radio and navigation are out, and it's up to you to work with your computer to get things going again.

Fortunately, your ship enabled your LARRY (Language-Aware Repair Robot of the Year), when the systems went offline. For some reason, the engineers who created LARRY made him duck-shaped, but he is very good at doing exactly what he is told to do. He has a terminal on his back that lets you use JavaScript to make changes to the ship.

Your job as captain of the ISS Lighthouse is to use your JavaScript skills to talk to LARRY and get your ship back in working order! You've got 21 days to fix the navigation and radio before the command centre back on Earth gets worried and launches another ship to come looking for you.

"POWER OFF!" quacks LARRY. That sounds like a big problem! You should probably get the power back on, otherwise things are not going to go very well for you in the depths of uncharted space! Unfortunately, the manual for your ship is hard to read in the dark.

"Ship's powerOn property set to false!" LARRY exclaims. "MUST CHANGE VALUE! QUACK!" Okay, that sounds pretty serious. Fortunately, you remember from orientation that there are things called "properties" in JavaScript. You access properties using the '.' operator. With just the light from LARRY's terminal, you need to write a function called powerOn() which will change the 'powerOn' property of the 'ship' object. If that's set to 'false', changing it to 'true' should get things going.

**Hint:** LARRY loudly quacks out, "Set values in JavaScript using a single equals sign."

## Challenge #2
The lights flicker on, and you can see the interior of the ship, along with LARRY, your duck-shaped friend. You feel relieved, until LARRY’s eyes start to glow red, and he starts blaring, "SHIP IN DANGER! SHIP IN DANGER!"

What can it be? You've turned the power back on, everything should be back to normal, right? "MODULES NOT ACTIVE!" Modules, what modules? A quick check of the ship's status board reveals an empty array labelled 'modules'.

You flip through the manual to the section labelled 'Modules', where the first page describes a number of available modules. They are stored in memory in the availableModules array. Each module is an object, with four properties:

the name of the module is a string
the size of the module is an integer
the enabled and essential properties are booleans
Start off by finding out how many modules there are. Make a function called countModules to reveal how many modules there are to choose from.

## Challenge #3

"QUACK QUACK QUACK QUACK QUACK QUACK QUACK", goes LARRY, his eyes still glowing red. He’s counting off each of the seven modules on the list - you must be on the right track! Now to find out how many of them are essential.

Use your JavaScript skills to write a function called countEssential() which will count how many modules from the availableModules array have the essential flag set.

## Challenge #4
"DANGER QUACK DANGER QUACK!"

LARRY seemed so happy before, but he really is starting to get a bit agitated. Now that you know there are three essential modules, maybe you should start loading them into the ship's systems.

Write a function called loadModule(). It needs to take a parameter, called index. Your function should be set up like this:

function loadModule(index) { }

When loadModule gets the index number of a module, it should load it into the ship's modules property (which is already an array). Before you load it in, set the enabled property to true. You need to loop over the availableModules and find the module called "life-support" and get its index, then use it to call loadModule().

**Hint:** You need to either loop through availableModules outside of any function or write a seperate function that handles the looping make sure it is called in your code"

## Challenge #5
"BREATHE EASIER!" LARRY quacks out. "LITERALLY. Life support module loaded. Propulsion needed."

You can re-use your code from before, but this time you should do what all good programmers do: modularize your code. Write a function called findModuleIndex() which will take in a name that you’re looking for, and return the index of that module in the availableModules array. Remember: it has to have the essential flag, too!

Use your findModuleIndex function to find the "propulsion" module and then load it into the ship's system.
